# Create an Application Security Group for Two Web Servers in Azure

**There are 3 objectives with this lab:**
* Create a New Application Security Group
* Create a New Network Security Rule
* Test Connectivity to the Web Servers



## Create a New Application Security Group

We first need to be able to log into Azure using the Linux jumpbox provided in the lab. We're going to use a Service Principal to view information in the portal from the jumpbox. So lets launch the Terminal first and then SSH into the Linux VM/jumpbox using

It should give you output that you're now logged into Azure. That completes the first objective of this lab! On to the next and final objective of this lab. 


## Create a New Network Security Rule

So for the next task, we need to list the Azure role definitions and assignments using the Linux VM command line. Now I don't have much experience with Linux so I had to google a bunch of commands to see how to create a file, append a file, get a  JSON output, and etc.

I created a Notepad file with all the links I used but I'm sure I'll also post the links here as well. 



That should suffice. Lab completed!

## Test Connectivity to the Web Servers


That should suffice. Lab completed!

## Personal Notes

So this lab was way more jarring than the previous very easy 3 labs. I'm not used to Linux, let alone the terminal so I needed to google what commands to use. Also, I didn't want to do a sloppy job so I was trying to find the cleanest way to get the job done. This is where I'm very
